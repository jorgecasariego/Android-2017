 * This will be the bridge between our app and SQLite.

 * Also, we have to add Database annotation in order to identify this class as your database.
 * This annotation contains some properties:

 *  - entities: defines the related entities of the current database. If you have more than one,
 *              you can separate by comma.
 *
 *  - version: defines the database version
 *
 *  In addition, we have to declare the DAOâ€™s as an abstract methods.
